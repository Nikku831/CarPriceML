# Car Price Prediction Model Using Linear Regression
## Overview:
The Car Price Prediction Model using Linear Regression is a machine learning model designed to predict the price of a car based on various features. Linear regression is a statistical method used for regression tasks, making it suitable for predicting continuous variables, such as car prices, based on input features.

## Features:
The model takes into account several features that are commonly associated with car prices. These features may include:

* name
* company
* year
* Price	kms_driven
* fuel_type

## Methodology 
* Data Collection: The model is trained on a dataset containing historical car sales data, including various features and their corresponding prices.

* Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables if necessary. Feature scaling and normalization are crucial to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's predictions.

* Model Training: The preprocessed data is then used to train a linear regression model. During training, the model learns the relationship between the input features and the target variable (car prices) by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) loss.

* Model Evaluation: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as the mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared score.

## Conclusion:
The Car Price Prediction Model using Linear Regression holds promise as a valuable tool for predicting car prices accurately. By leveraging historical sales data and machine learning techniques, the model can assist car dealerships, buyers, and sellers in estimating the fair market value of cars and making informed decisions.
